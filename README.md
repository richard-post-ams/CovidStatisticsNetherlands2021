# CovidStatisticsNetherlands2021

Currently I am working with multiple software-(data) teams for a major American
company in the Netherlands, but not as developer (I am working as a Scrum Master).
Actually I want to move into (Python/Numpy/Pandas) coding, for Data Science.
So this is about my journey to move into that area. I realize that I need to
spend a lot of time to be a good developer.

A long time ago I have been a developer (Pascal). I am very eager to learn
Python, Numpy , Pandas, Spark. I have spend already a lot of time to learn
Python/Numpy/Pandas via CodeCademy, so now it's time to bring my learnings into
practice.

This project is about statistics regarding Covid in the Netherlands.
To learn fast and to share my knowledge I added as much comments as possible.
The program will pull live Covid-19 data via web-scraping.
There are a lot of numbers available from many countries. In this project
I generate relevant Covid-19 graphs focusing on the Netherlands, to Visual
analyse in a realtime way how we are doing at this moment in the Netherlands.

Note July 2023: TheNetherlands is nort part of tha stats anymore, since we have minor Covid cases in The Netherlands in July 2023.

While creating the graphs I will have more ideas on exactly what I would
like to analyse. This project will evolve while working on it.

For this project the following steps are taken:
Data Collection (acquiring correct data at right time)
Data Pre Processing
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Conclusions (did the analysis answer our questions, was there a limitation
in our analysis which could affect our conclusion, was analysis sufficient
enough in decision making).
